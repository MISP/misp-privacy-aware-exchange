# Simple execution like in the article

## Lookup in function of the number of contained IP
"""Linear"""

## Rules space in function of the number of Elements (IP, ..)
"""Only depend on the message size but Linear"""

## Bruteforcing range ip (/24)
### Reactions in function of the number of IPs
"""Linear as the size of an IP is equivalent"""


### Reactions in function on the number of iterations
""""Linear for the same reason"""

## Time to brute force increasing size elements
"""Should be exponential"""
